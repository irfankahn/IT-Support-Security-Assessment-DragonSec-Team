This project, developed during my senior year at Drexel University’s College of Computing & Informatics, focuses on comprehensive security assessments combining IT support and cybersecurity best practices. The DragonSec Team led in-depth vulnerability assessments and penetration testing across institutional networks, web applications, and physical infrastructure. The approach was holistic, covering all layers of security—from software and hardware to digital and physical environments.

The assessment process involved extensive reconnaissance, scanning, and risk analysis using industry-standard tools such as Nmap, Shodan, Metasploit, Kali Linux, and OWASP ZAP. Testing methodologies adhered closely to recognized frameworks including NIST SP 800-115 and OWASP Top 10, ensuring rigor and relevance. Beyond technical testing, the project emphasized clear communication by delivering detailed technical reports and executive summaries that outlined identified security gaps, assessed risk levels, and proposed actionable mitigation strategies.

This initiative highlights the critical role of integrating IT support functions with proactive cybersecurity measures, including safeguarding physical assets, securing digital data, reinforcing software resilience, and managing hardware vulnerabilities. It demonstrates how a layered defense strategy is vital for protecting organizational resources against evolving threats in today’s interconnected environments.
